\section{Reproducing the obtained results}
In the \verb|src/| folder inside the submission archive you can find a \verb|Makefile|.\\\\
Run command \verb|make| while having the current working directory set as the \verb|src/| folder to plot and store all the results used for this report. All the plots and blurred/unblurred images are saved inside the \verb|src/out| folder. Make sure to uncomment the \verb|png(...)| statements for the files you want to generate.\\\\
